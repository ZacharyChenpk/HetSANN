### HetSANN: Heterogeneous Graph Structural Attention Neural Network
This is a simple pytorch implementation of AAAI'20 paper from Didi Lab:

Huiting Hong, Hantao Guo, Yucheng Lin, Xiaoqing Yang, Zang Li, Jieping Ye. 2020. An Attention-based Graph Nerual Network for Heterogeneous Structural Learning. In Proceedings of AAAI conference (AAAIâ€™20).

### How to run
python3 model.py

Because of the lacking in test data referred in the paper, I haven't implement the result testing part, and it's recommended to inject it into your bigger model. Calling for the dataset(heterogeneous graph classification task), too.
